			<h2>Making complex things <span class="yellow-underline">simple</span>.</h2>
			<p>
				I’m an interaction designer interested in dealing with messy challenges. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I was previously at <a href="www.minitheory.com" target="_blank">Minitheory</a>, where I worked in diverse projects such as a software for financial simulation for <a href="http://www.aon.com/reinsurance/analytics/remetrica.jsp" target="_blank">Aon ReMetrica</a>, redesigning the <a href="https://www.m1.com.sg/personal/add-onservices/mym1app" target="_blank">M1 app</a> and prototyping with <a href="https://www.ideo.com/us" target="_blank">IDEO Singapore</a> for a local bank.
			</p>
			<p>
				I’ve also taught a short course on research and design with <a href="https://www.alphacamp.co/sg/ux-workshop-series/" target="_blank">Alphacamp</a>.

				<h3 class="project-title">My M1</h3>
				<p>M1 is one of the main telco providers in Singapore, and serves millions of customers. Their previous app allowed customers to self-service, but it was difficult to use.</p>
				<p>I led 2 designers on the project, simplifying the navigation and introducing more consistent flows for subscribing to M1's services.</p>

				<h3 class="project-title">ReMetrica, Aon</h3>
				<p>ReMetrica is a decade-old risk simulation tool used by actuaries worldwide. The team decided to fundamentally re-build and re-design the software to use best-in-class technology to prepare for the next decade.</p>
				<p>I worked in their agile development team, helping with all aspects from the initial user research to front-end development. ReMetrica launched in April 2016 in London and Singapore, and won Actuarial Post’s Software of the Year award.</p>

				<h3 class="project-title">Singapore Legal Advice</h3>
				<p>When you’re looking for a lawyer, you probably don’t want to deal with jargon and wading through lots of text. I helped reorganize the content to help people quickly find what was relevant.</p>
				<p>Since the launch, the client saw a +18% increase in queries for lawyers on the site!</p>
