			<p>
				I’m Charmaine! Nice to meet you. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm an interaction designer – I shape the experiences that people have with screens (or machines). To me, people come first, not technology. I am interested in how people see the world, what they care about, and how technology fits into our lives in a helpful and meaningful way.

				Today, I am part of <a href="http://www.designingagency.com" target="_blank">Agency</a>, a human-centred design practice based in Singapore. Understanding people is a really important part of our process – in the last year, I think I've interviewed at least 50 people over various projects!

				Previously, I was with the awesome folks at <a href="http://www.minitheory.com" target="_blank">Minitheory</a>. In a past life, I studied computing at NUS... and fell in love with design. I also enjoy drawing in my free time!

				<h3 class="project-title">My M1</h3>
				<p>M1 is one of the main telco providers in Singapore, and serves millions of customers. Their previous app allowed customers to self-service, but it was difficult to use.</p>
				<p>I led 2 designers on the project, simplified the navigation and made consistent flows for subscribing to services.</p>

				<h3 class="project-title">ReMetrica, Aon</h3>
				<p>ReMetrica is a decade-old risk simulation tool used by actuaries worldwide. The team decided to re-build and re-design the software to prepare for the next decade.</p>
				<p>I worked in their agile development team, helping with all aspects from the initial user research, design to front-end development. In 2016, the new ReMetrica won Actuarial Post’s Software of the Year award.</p>

				<h3 class="project-title">Singapore Legal Advice</h3>
				<p>When you’re looking for a lawyer, you probably don’t want to deal with jargon and wading through lots of text. I helped reorganize the content to help people quickly find what was relevant.</p>
				<p>Since the launch, the client saw a +18% increase in queries for lawyers on the site.</p>
