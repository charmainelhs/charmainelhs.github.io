			<h2>Making complex things <span class="yellow-underline">simple</span>.</h2>
			<p>
				I’m an interaction designer interested in messy challenges. Well-designed search, intuitive navigation and concise interfaces make my heart beat faster.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was previously with the awesome folks at <a href="www.minitheory.com" target="_blank">Minitheory</a>, where I worked in projects such as a financial software called <a href="http://www.aon.com/reinsurance/analytics/remetrica.jsp" target="_blank">ReMetrica</a>, redesigning the <a href="https://www.m1.com.sg/personal/add-onservices/mym1app" target="_blank">M1 app</a> and prototyping with <a href="https://www.ideo.com/us" target="_blank">IDEO SG</a> for a local bank.
			</p>
			<p>
				In a past life, I studied computing at NUS. That was pretty useful. In 2015, the hardest thing I did was teach research and design at <a href="https://www.alphacamp.co/sg/ux-workshop-series/" target="_blank">Alphacamp</a>.
			</p>

			<p>Always happy to grab kopi and chat about design, tech and ideas. Ping me at <a class="cta-link" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&source=mailto&su=Hello&to=charmainelhs@gmail.com" target="_top">charmainelhs[at]gmail.com</a>.</p>

				<h3 class="project-title">My M1</h3>
				<p>M1 is one of the main telco providers in Singapore, and serves millions of customers. Their previous app allowed customers to self-service, but it was difficult to use.</p>
				<p>I led 2 designers on the project, simplified the navigation and made consistent flows for subscribing to services.</p>

				<h3 class="project-title">ReMetrica, Aon</h3>
				<p>ReMetrica is a decade-old risk simulation tool used by actuaries worldwide. The team decided to fundamentally re-build and re-design the software to use best-in-class technology to prepare for the next decade.</p>
				<p>I worked in their agile development team, helping with all aspects from the initial user research to front-end development. ReMetrica launched in April 2016 in London and Singapore, and won Actuarial Post’s Software of the Year award.</p>

				<h3 class="project-title">Singapore Legal Advice</h3>
				<p>When you’re looking for a lawyer, you probably don’t want to deal with jargon and wading through lots of text. I helped reorganize the content to help people quickly find what was relevant.</p>
				<p>Since the launch, the client saw a +18% increase in queries for lawyers on the site!</p>
